Assignment 1

Problem 4: 
  1. the getCourse() method uses ArrayList<>() data structure to dynamically create a collection of Strings, which are names of the four courses.
  2. use nextInt(int n) method in Random() class to generate an random integer in 1 â€¦ 3
  3. use the random number in ArrayList.get(int n) method to return an element of random index in the ArrayList

Problem 5:
  1. modified the if condition for checking illegal input (n < 0 instead of 0 <= 0)
  2. modified the if condition for checking base cases (n < 2 instead of n <= 2)
  3. modified the recursion based on the property of Fibonacci sequence (plus instead of minus)

Problem 6:
  ReverseNumber.java:
  1. convert the input number(including sign) to char[]
  2. use two pointers to swap chars at symmetric positions recursively
  3. in the recursion, also handle the case when there is a '-' sign at the start of the char[], we don't swap the '-' char
  4. return the int with the value of the string representation of the char[]
  ReverseNumberTest.java:
  1. test that exception will be thrown when the reversed number is out of int range [-2^31, 2^31-1]
  2. test that exception will not be thrown otherwise
  3. test the method will work correctly for negative, zero, and positive integer as input
